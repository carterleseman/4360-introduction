    "name": "My name is Carter Leseman. I am in my junior year.",
    "why": "I chose Computer Science because I like seeing immediate results. I also love working with computers. I have since I was a child. My father is working in the field, so I thought I might as well follow in his footsteps.",
    "what": "I don't necessarily have a specific area of Computer Science that I'm absolutely sold on. I feel that I'd be okay with anything, but if I had to choose, it'd be web development or IT. Anything that isn't database work.",
    "fact": [
        "I love old cartoons. Much more than the new stuff. I'm talking Heathcliff, The Jetsons, Garfield and Friends, etc. The same goes for movies.",
        "I dislike driving long distances. Highway driving especially isn't for me. There's something about high speeds that puts me off.",
        "I can't cook for shit, but every once in a while I'll follow some guide online and feel like I could be the second coming of Ratatouille."
